# Deploy to Vercel at End of Process

After completing any code or content changes in this project, **finish the process** with the deploy flow so the live site on Vercel is updated:

1. **Build**: Run `npm run build` (must succeed).
2. **Commit**: Stage and commit changes with a clear message (e.g. `feat: ...` or `fix: ...`).
3. **Remind**: Tell the user to run `git push` from their machine (or run it if credentials are available) so Vercel builds from the repo.

Optional: If the project has a `npm run deploy` script, prefer that when appropriate (it may do build + commit + push).

Do not consider the task fully done until the deploy step is offered or completed.
