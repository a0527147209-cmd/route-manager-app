# Deploy to Vercel at End of Process

**Every change, no matter how small:** After any code or content change in this project, **automatically** offer (or run) the git update flow:

1. **Commit**: Run `git add -A` and `git commit -m "..."` with a short, clear message (e.g. `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`).
2. **Remind**: Tell the user to run `git push` from their machine so Vercel builds from the repo.

Optional: Run `npm run build` first if the change might affect build; then commit.

Do not consider the task fully done until you have offered or run the commit and reminded about `git push`. The user asked for this to happen **automatically** after every small change.
